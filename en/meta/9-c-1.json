Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.","rationale_interpretation":"The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone networks often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.","computation_methods":"The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator":"9.c.1","target_id":"9.c","sdg_goal":"9","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"09-0c-01"}
