The 'international poverty line' is currently set at $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. ","concepts":"Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys.\nThe World Bank's Development Research Group maintains a database that is updated annually as new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day global, regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for different poverty lines.","rationale_interpretation":"In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about \u201cglobal poverty?\u201d Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way\u2014both are either poor or not poor\u2014even if they live in different countries. Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank\u2019s International Comparison Program (ICP).","data_sources":"Integrated Household Budget and Labour Force Sample Survey (hereinafter IHBLFSS).","data_collection":"Data are obtained through the IHBLFSS questionnaires using a cluster sample built on the latest available Census and up-to-date housing lists. The IHBLFS surveys rely on personal interviews collected using tablet computers (ComputerAssisted Personal Interview, CAPI).\nData are collected on a quarterly basis and an indicator is calculated using data for the past year.","computation_methods":"To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank\u2019s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what \u201cpoverty\u201d means in the world\u2019s poorest countries. The original \u201c$1- a-day\u201d line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). Within the World Bank, the Global Poverty Working Group (GPWG) is in charge of the collection, validation and estimation of poverty estimates. GPWG archives the datasets obtained from NSOs and then harmonizes them, applying common methodologies. The objective of the GPWG is to ensure that poverty and inequality data generated, curated, and disseminated by the World Bank are up to date, meet high-quality standards, and are well documented and consistent across dissemination channels. Members of GPWG generate and update the estimates for the proportion of population below the international poverty line using raw data typically provided by country governments. The raw data can be unit-record survey data, or grouped data, depending on the agreements with the country governments. The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. When measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $\u2019s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.","comments_limitations":"National poverty is a different concept than global poverty. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with the $1.90-a-day poverty rate.","quality_assurance":"Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities. The raw data are obtained by poverty economists through their contacts in the NSOs, and checked for quality before being submitted for further analysis.","data_availability_gaps":"Data Availability (measured in terms of number of countries that have at least 1 data point by region) Data on Kyrgyzstan are published annually.","disaggregation":"National and subnational levels","international_comparability":"Within the World Bank\u2019s international database, data are harmonized and comparable with other countries.

The information collected seeks to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator also serves for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).\nPrinciples and objectives of the Migration Governance Framework:\n1. Adherence to international standards and fulfillment of migrant\u2019s rights.\n2. Evidence and whole of-government approaches to migration governance.\n3. Strong partnerships to support migration governance.\n\nThe three principles propose the necessary conditions for migration to be well-managed by creating a more effective environment for maximized results for migration to be beneficial to all. These represent the means through which a State can ensure that the systemic requirements for good migration governance are in place. \nThe three objectives are specific and do not require any further conventions, laws or practices than the ones that are already existing. Taken together, these objectives ensure that migration is governed in an integrated and holistic way, responding to the need to consider mobile categories of people and address their needs for assistance in the event of an emergency, building resilience of individuals and communities, as well as ensuring opportunities for the economic and social health of the State.","concepts":"SDG target 10.7 is broad in scope and many, but not all, of the terms are well defined. The IOM Glossary on Migration  provides a definition of key concepts such as orderly and regular migration, but not others such as safe and responsible migration. According to the Glossary, orderly migration refers to \u201cthe movement of a person from his/her usual place of residence, in keeping with the laws and regulations governing exit of the country of origin and travel, transit and entry into the host country\u201d. Regular is defined as \u201cmigration that occurs through recognized, legal channels\u201d. \n\nWhile the concept of \u201cwell-managed migration policies\u201d is not explicitly defined, according to the IOM Glossary, it is included in references to migration management, migration governance and facilitated migration. Migration management refers to the planned approach to the development of policy, and legislative and administrative responses to key migration issues. Migration governance is defined as a system of institutions, legal frameworks, mechanisms and practices aimed at regulating migration and protecting migrants. Facilitated migration refers to fostering or encouraging regular migration, for example through streamlined visa application process.","rationale_interpretation":"The time series is the result of an evaluation composed of 30 questions grouped in six domains. These six domains are:\n1. Migrant rights\n2. Whole-of-government/Evidence-based policies\n3. Cooperation and partnerships\n4. Socioeconomic well-being\n5. Mobility dimension of crises\n6. Safe, orderly and regular migration\n\nBased on the answers an overall score can be calculated across all six domains. Categories of the\noverall score are:\n\u2022 Values of less than 40 are coded as \u201cRequires further progress\u201d = 1 Point\n\u2022 Values of 40 to less than 80 are coded as \u201cPartially meets\u201d = 2 Points\n\u2022 Values of 80 to less than 100 are coded as \u201cMeets\u201d = 3 Points\n\u2022 Values of 100 are coded as \u201cFully meets\u201d = 4 Points","data_sources":"The source of data is the UN Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development, which has been used to survey global population policies since 1963, including policies on international migration. The Inquiry is mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 1838 (XVII) of 18 December 1962. The Inquiry consists mostly of multiple-choice questions. \n\nTwo successive rounds of the Inquiry have been used to collect data on indicator 10.7.2: the Twelfth Inquiry, conducted between September 2018 and October 2019, and the Thirteenth Inquiry, conducted between November 2020 and October of 2021. The Twelfth Inquiry is divided into three thematic modules: Module I on population ageing and urbanization; Module II on fertility, family planning and reproductive health; and Module III on international migration. Module III of the Twelfth Inquiry has been updated to include core questions for all the six migration policy domains mentioned above. The Thirteenth Inquiry is divided into two thematic modules: Module I on reproductive health; and Module II on international migration.","data_collection":"The Inquiry is conducted on behalf of the Secretary-General and is sent to all Permanent Missions in New York: 193 Member States, 2 observer States, and 2 non-member States. As per past practice, the Permanent Missions redirect the three thematic modules of the Inquiry to the relevant line ministries or government departments who are tasked with answering the questions. The Inquiry modules can be completed either through an online questionnaire or a fillable questionnaire in PDF. Countries responses are transmitted back to UN DESA for basic consistency checking. The data are then compiled/integrated into the World Population Policies database. The results of the Inquiry are disseminated though the database, updated every two years. \n\nAs part of the collaboration on SDG indicator 10.7.2, IOM assisted in garnering country responses to the international migration module of the Inquiry by following up through its respective country or regional counterparts. OECD, as partner agency for this indicator, supported these efforts for its member countries. The collaboration increased response rates from countries and improved the quality of the data. \n\nThe data were collected biennially between 2019 and 2021, to ensure that there is sufficient information to monitor progress in the achievement of the target. In the future, the periodicity of the Inquiry will be modified to quadrennial. This will also allow for gathering benchmark data once within each HLPF 4-year cycle.\n\nNo adjustments to standard classifications are envisioned. ","computation_methods":"The indicator includes a total of 30 sub-categories, under 6 questions/domains. All sub-categories, except for those under domain 1, have dichotomous \u201cYes/No\u201d answers, coded \u201c1\u201d for \u201cYes\u201d and \u201c0\u201d for \u201cNo\u201d. For the sub-categories under domain 1, there are three possible answers: \u201cYes, regardless of immigration status\u201d, coded \u201c1\u201d; \u201cYes, only for those with legal immigration status\u201d, coded \u201c0.5\u201d; and \u201cNo\u201d coded \u201c0\u201d.\n\nFor each domain, the computational methodology is the unweighted average of the values across sub-categories :\n\nD_i  =  (\u2211_j^n\u2592s_ji )/n  \u00d7100\n\nWhere D_i refers to the value for domain i;\u2211_j^n\u2592s_ji  refers to the sum of the values across sub-categories (indexed by j) under domain i; and n refers to the total number of sub-categories in a domain (n=5). Results are reported as percentages. For each domain, values of D_i range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 per cent.\n\nThe overall summary indicator 10.7.2 for a country is obtained by computing the unweighted average of the values of the 30 sub-categories under the six domains, with values ranging between 0 and 100 per cent. \n\nFor ease of interpretation and to summarize results, the resulting country-level averages (for the overall indicator and by domain) are then categorized as follows: values of less than 40 are coded as \u201cRequires further progress\u201d; values of 40 to less than 80 are coded as \u201cPartially meets\u201d, values of 80 to less than 100 are coded as \u201cMeets\u201d; and values of 100 are coded as \u201cFully meets\u201d.

It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting.

For example, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reading test has six proficiency levels, of which Level 2 is described as the minimum proficiency level. In Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), there are four proficiency levels: Low, Intermediate, High and Advanced. Students reaching the Intermediate benchmark are able to apply basic knowledge in a variety of situations, similar to the idea of minimum proficiency. Currently, there are no common standards validated by the international community or countries. The indicator shows data published by each of the agencies and organizations specialized in cross-national learning assessments. \n\n2) The National Assessment of Student Educational Achievements (NASEA) in the Kyrgyz Republic has been conducted four times. The aim of NASEA is to obtain objective, scientifically based data of what students know and able to do in accordance with the national education standard and to identify factors impacting educational outcomes. The study was conducted in grades 4 and 8 in Mathematics, Reading and Understanding and Sciences (in the 4th grade as part of the Native Studies subject).","rationale_interpretation":"1) The indicator is a direct measure of the learning outcomes achieved in the two subject areas at the end of the relevant stages of education. The three measurement points will have their own established minimum standard. There is only one threshold that divides students into above and below minimum:\n(a) Below minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who do not achieve a minimum standard as set up by countries according to the globally-defined minimum competencies.\n(b) Above minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who have achieved the minimum standards. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will have to be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels. Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of children who achieved minimum standards. \n\nNASEA study was conducted based on stratified sample across the Kyrgyz Republic. The following strata were selected: categories of schools (Bishkek, regional centers and small towns, rural schools), languages of instruction (Kyrgyz, Russian, Uzbek) administrative regions of Kyrgyzstan.\nTests and questionnaires for students, school administrators and teachers are the NASEA tools. NASEA assessment matches results to students\u2019 achievement levels.\nThe study uses four levels of educational achievement: below the basic (level 1), basic (level 2), above the basic (level 3), and high achievement (level 4). The minimum acceptable level is basic (2). The levels of students\u2019 achievements were identified both in general terms and for each subject area, describing students results at a given level in accordance with national standards and programmes.\nGrades 4 and 8 have been chosen for the study for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Grade 4 completes primary school and serves as the basis for further education. Knowledge and skills acquired by students during primary school can be evaluated upon completion of this stage. It is particularly important to know what students have actually learned at the end of primary school, as further successful learning depends on it.\n\u2022 Grade 8 for assessment was chosen by the Ministry of Education and Science. This grade precedes the final year of compulsory education, and assessment at this stage makes it possible to make the necessary adjustments in grade 9.","data_sources":"1) Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2018 (MICS)\n\n2) Ministry of Education and Science of the Kyrgyz Republic.

For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of household-based income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks.","data_sources":"Integrated Household Budget and Labour Force Sample Survey","data_collection":"Data collected through quarterly questionnaire \u21161 \u00abHousehold control card\u00bb and annual questionnaire \u21167 \u00abHousehold assets and housing conditions\u00bb, section 1 \u00abHousing Conditions\u00bb of the Integrated Household Budget and Labour Force Sample Survey.","computation_methods":"Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of individuals living in households with access to electricity, calculated by formula:\n y=n/N*100, where\nn = number of people living in households with access to electricity,\nN = total population","disaggregation":"The indicator is disaggregated by region (geographical and urban/rural location), sex, age group, educational level.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator_number":"7.1.1","target_number":"7.1","goal_number":"7","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-01"},"2-3-2-b":{"goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Fish consumption balance","graph_title":"Fish consumption balance","national_geographical_coverage":"Kyrgyz Republic","measurement_units":"Kilograms per year","tags":["National"],"page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-08-15","goal_name":"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture","target_name":"2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment","indicator_name1":"2.3.2.b Fish consumption balance","organization_name":"National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (Department of Agricultural Statistics)","contact_name":"Mursabekova G.T.","contact_email":"g.mursabekova@stat.kg","contact_phone":"(0312) 60 40 43","organization_website":"www.stat.gov.kg","definitions":"Balances of basic foodstuffs are a system of indicators characterizing the sources of resource formation and channels of their use, reflecting the movement of basic products from the moment of production to the moment of their final use, and predicting the development of the situation on the food market.

For the last age range of 100 years and older in the full mortality tables (or 85 years and older in the short tables), the probability of death is 1.\nMortality tables are an ordered sequence of values showing how a certain conditional generation of those born would gradually decrease during the transition from younger to older ages under the influence of the mortality rate existing in a given year.

A change in the value of this indicator may be the result of economic, political, social reforms, as well as changes in the ideology of society. Life expectancy is the main indicator used to assess the health of the population, as it indicates the mortality rate among the population. OPJ characterizes not only the current state, but also the quality of life of the respective generations in the past, since the state of health of a particular person largely depends on the conditions of his existence from the very moment of birth. \nThe analysis of this indicator makes it possible to assess the level of socio-economic well-being of the population, the effectiveness of sanitary and hygienic preventive measures, as well as the quality of medical and preventive services for the population of the republic as a whole and in the context of administrative\nterritories. \nBoth infant mortality and the overall mortality rate have a significant impact on the life expectancy index. \nThe unit of measurement of the indicator is years.","data_sources":"The calculations use data on the number of deaths, distributed by gender and one-year age groups (from the mortality table), and data from the annual assessment of the sex and age composition of the population.

The amount of man-years obtained is divided by the number of people who have reached the appropriate age. \nResidence permit for persons over a certain age (15, 45 and 65 years) - (e(x) is determined by the formula: e(x) = Tx / Ix , where: x is the age (15, 45, 65 years); Tx is the number of person-years; Ix is the number of people, who have lived to the appropriate age.\n","comments_limitations":"\"Mortality tables are based on a specific calendar date, which is important to avoid unreasonable conclusions that \"every man will live an average of 64 years, and a woman - 73 years.\" It should be noted that such a statement is valid only with the following caveat: \"if the same age-related mortality rates are maintained throughout their lives as they were in the year of calculation.\"\nIn addition, almost all mortality tables are built not for real, but for conditional generations. The real generation, as already noted, is a generation in the usual sense, i.e. the totality of those born in a certain small time interval (usually during a calendar year) or, more precisely, the totality of those born during a time interval, the differences within which can be ignored. \nAn analysis of the mortality tables shows that the higher the mortality rate among children aged 0 to 5 years, the lower the rate of life expectancy at birth and with increasing age, the average life expectancy decreases.\"","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of the reporting data, analysis of the output tables is carried out.

There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socioeconomic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities.

Typical conditions such as these form the basis for constructing scales based on the experience of measuring food insecurity. The severity of food insecurity measured by this indicator therefore directly reflects the extent to which households or individuals are unable to regularly access the food they need.","rationale_interpretation":"Food insecurity at a moderate level of severity is usually associated with the inability to regularly receive a healthy, balanced diet. Thus, the high prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered as a prediction of various forms of population health conditions related to nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies and unbalanced nutrition. On the other hand, severe levels of food insecurity imply a high probability of reduced food intake and, therefore, can lead to more serious forms of malnutrition, including hunger.","data_sources":"A household survey that collects information on food purchases may be sufficient to reliably assess the prevalence of malnutrition among the population at a reasonable cost and inform monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals with the necessary frequency, provided that: a) all sources of food consumption for all household members, including, in particular, food consumed outside the home is properly accounted for; b) sufficient information is available to convert data on food consumption or food expenditure into their contribution to caloric intake; c) correct methods are used to calculate the prevalence of malnutrition in order to regulate excessive variability in the estimated level of habitual food consumption among households, allowing for normal variability in the distribution of food consumption among individuals. caused by differences in the energy needs of residents.\n\nHowever, in practice, it is often impossible and undesirable to rely solely on data obtained from household surveys, as the information needed to assess the four parameters of the malnutrition prevalence model is missing or inaccurate.","data_collection":"The official information on food production, trade and application used by FAO to compile food balances is provided mainly by the statistical units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a questionnaire for data collection each year with a designated focal point. Microdata from household surveys is usually owned and provided by national statistical agencies. Whenever possible, FAO receives data directly through the website of national statistical agencies.

FAO provides versions of the SHOPPME adapted and translated into each of the more than 200 languages and dialects used in the Worldwide Gallup Survey. When used in a Worldwide Gallup Survey, with a sample size of only about 1,000 individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of about 50% are estimated with an error of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals are likely to be much smaller if national prevalence rates are estimated using larger samples. Compared to other proposed informal indicators of household food insecurity, the SHOPB-based approach has the advantage that the prevalence of food insecurity is directly comparable between population groups and countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" and \"severe\" food insecurity), other approaches have yet to demonstrate formal comparability of the thresholds used for classification due to the lack of definition of proper statistical models that relate the values of the \"indexes\" or \"scores\" used for classifications of the severity of food insecurity. For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results obtained by SHOPB with those obtained with these other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them.","data_availability_gaps":"Data for 2014 and 2015 are available from FAO for the 146 countries, regions and territories included in the Gallup Global Survey.

Equalization is a form of metric standardization based on the identification of a subset of elements that can be considered common to global SHOPPING and the specific scale used to measure in each context. The severity levels associated with general articles are used as anchor points for adjusting global SHOPPING thresholds on a local scale. The standardization process ensures that the mean and standard deviation of a set of common elements are the same when measured on a global or national scale. Compatibility with global SHOPB and the ability to compile this indicator require that at least four of the eight SHOPB elements be identified as common.

The death of a woman in any period of pregnancy, in childbirth, or within 42 days of its end refers to maternal mortality. Therefore, if the deceased was pregnant (regardless of the duration and location of pregnancy) or died in childbirth or within 42 days after giving birth, the medical death certificate must contain an entry about the duration of pregnancy or the number of days of the postpartum period, even if the pregnancy was not related to the underlying cause of death.","data_sources":"The source of information about the causes of death is the entries in medical death certificates drawn up by a doctor or secondary medical staff regarding illness, accident, murder, suicide and other external influences that caused death.

The maternal mortality rate can be calculated by dividing the registered (or estimated) maternal mortality by the total number of registered (or estimated) live births over the same period, and multiplied by 100,000.

Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age, either married or in a union, who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception.\nModern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring).","rationale_interpretation":"The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services.

Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes.

The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.","rationale_interpretation":"The indicator allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households\u2019 ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time.","data_sources":"Integrated Household Budget and Labour Force Sample Survey (hereinafter IHBLFSS) contains a module on household food consumption and spending on food consumed outside the home as well as household gender and age composition.","data_collection":"Data are obtained through the IHBLFSS questionnaires using a cluster sample built on the latest available Census and up-to-date housing lists. The IHBLFS surveys rely on personal interviews collected using tablet computers (ComputerAssisted Personal Interview, CAPI).\nData are collected on a quarterly basis and an indicator is calculated using data for the past year.","computation_methods":"The indicator is computed at the population level. \nThere are two common computation methods for this indicator.\n1. Population is represented by an \u201caverage\u201d individual for whom a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels is modeled through a parametric probability density function. A custom function (R) is available to compute the prevalence of malnutrition given the four parameters of the calorie intake estimation (DEC), coefficient of variation (CV), asymmetry (Skew) and the minimum caloric intake (MDER);\n2. 2100Kcal taken as the world average minimum calorie diet value. The average per capita calorie intake of a household is calculated given sex composition of the household.\nIn Kyrgyzstan, the indicator is calculated using second method and describes proportion of population consuming less than 2,100 Kcal.","comments_limitations":"Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods.","quality_assurance":"The raw data are checked for quality before being submitted for further analysis.","data_availability_gaps":"A compatible time series calculated using common methodology has been available since 2000.","disaggregation":"National and subnational level, by area.","international_comparability":"DEC can be obtained either from survey data or from Food Balance Sheets. Both sources have limitations. Comparisons of national DEC based on FBS and surveys often reveal discrepancies. In order to limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of country malnutrition level as three-year averages, assuming that errors caused by inaccurate indices recording in each individual year, may be reduced if the average is considered for three consecutive years.\nThe national indicator computation methodology significantly differs from that of FAO. The most common approach used in preparing national reports has been to calculate the percentage of households for which the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption is found to be below thresholds based on daily Recommended Dietary Intake, usually set at 2,100.00 kcal, based on household survey data.","references_documentation":"http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/en/ \nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/012/w0931e/w0931e16.pdf \nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4249E/y4249e06.htm#bm06\nhttp://www.fao.org/3/a-i4060e.pdf \nhttp://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf\n\nKR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator_number":"2.1.1","target_number":"2.1","goal_number":"2","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"02-01-01","computation_units":"Percentage (%)"},"1-3-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata","national_geographical_coverage":"\u041a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-03-01a.pdf","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"\u0414\u043e\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043c/\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b (\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u044f)","indicator_name":"Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable","measurement_units":"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-08-15","goal_name":"1.

Child labour is a legal concept rather than a statistical one, and the international legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child labour statistics. The three principal international conventions on child labour \u2013 ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182), and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it.\nIn December 2008, the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) adopted the Resolution concerning statistics of child labour. This Resolution helps in translating the legal standards governing child labour into statistical terms. In particular, the Resolution is designed to set standards for the collection, compilation and analysis of national child labour statistics, and to guide countries in updating their existing statistical system in this field.\nIn accordance with the Resolution, and on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), child labour is defined for measurement purposes to include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period: \n\u2022 hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 21 to 32); \n\u2022 worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 33 to 34); and \n\u2022 employment below the minimum working age, excluding, where applicable, \u201clight work\u201d, performed by children aged not less than 12 or 13 years (18th ICLS, paragraphs 35 to 37).","rationale_interpretation":"Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future.

Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo rigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations give rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data reconciliations. JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any. JMP has also developed an online tool to facilitate future data validation and expanded its online capabilities so that these reconciliations could be done in much more interactive and real time manner, reducing cost of reconciliations missions.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator_number":"6.1.1","target_number":"6.1","goal_number":"6","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"06-01-01"},"2-c-1-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Consumer price index for food products","graph_title":"Consumer price index for food products","national_geographical_coverage":"\u041a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430","measurement_units":"Percentage compared to December of the previous year","tags":["National"],"page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2025-08-15","goal_name":"2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.","target_name":"2.\u0441 Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility","indicator_name1":"2.c.1.1 Consumer price index for food products in the Kyrgyz Republic and by regions","organization_name":"National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (Price Statistics Department)","contact_name":"Nurbaeva A.T.","contact_email":"anurbaeva@stat.kg","contact_phone":"+996 (312) 62-58-25","organization_website":"www.stat.gov.kg","definitions":"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects changes in the general price level for goods and services purchased by the population for non-productive consumption over time.
