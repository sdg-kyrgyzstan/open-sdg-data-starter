NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force and are in education, and thus currently cannot be considered available for work. This shows how many young people need social support and employment.","data_sources":"Integrated Household Budget and Labour Force Sample Survey (Form \u21164 \"Employment and unemployment\")","data_collection":"The survey is conducted by interviewers visiting households and recording data in tablets based on questionnaires approved by the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.
