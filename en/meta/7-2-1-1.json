","concepts":"Renewable energy sources (RES) are energy sources that are continuously renewable due to naturally occurring natural processes. \nRenewable energy consumption includes the consumption of energy derived from hydropower, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal and other sources.\n","rationale_interpretation":"Renewable energy technologies are one of the main elements of the strategy for greening the economy around the world and solving the most important global problem of climate change. There are a number of definitions of renewable energy sources; the common one is that all the presented forms of energy, despite their consumption, will be available in the future. These include solar energy, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy that may be depleted, bioenergy sources can be replaced in the short and medium term). It is important to note that this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed, rather than on the renewable energy production capacity, which may not always be fully utilized.","data_sources":"The source of information is the calculated fuel and energy balance, which is compiled on the basis of official statistical reporting data in the form No. 1-TEB (annual) \"Fuel and Energy Balance Report\". The fuel and energy Balance provides information on the production, availability, distribution and consumption of fuel and other types of energy.","data_collection":"Economic entities with the status of a legal entity, regardless of their form of ownership, that produce or consume fuel or the following types of energy are subject to coverage: oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, natural gas, coal, electricity and heat. The method is a continuous statistical survey based on mandatory statistical reporting. The TEB is formed by recalculating all indicators of product balances, presented in physical terms, into thousands of tons of conventional fuel (here), using average coefficients for converting product balances from natural units of measurement to conventional ones.","computation_methods":"The indicator is defined as the ratio of the volume of energy consumption from renewable energy sources to the total consumption of fuel and energy resources, percentages.\n\n                                     Dvie=Vpie/Vpe\u00d7100 where, \n\nVee \u2013 energy consumption from renewable energy sources;\nVpe is the total consumption of fuel and energy resources.\n","comments_limitations":"Data on renewable energy sources are generated according to the State Classification of Types of Economic Activity (GCED), which is based on the Classification of Types of Economic Activity by the Statistical Commission of the European Union (NACE). Calculations are performed in accordance with the methodology for calculating the fuel and energy balance (TEB).","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of the reporting data is carried out.","data_availability_gaps":"Dynamic series have been available since 2010. The data are published in the statistical collection \"Fuel and Energy Balance\", posted on the NSC website.","disaggregation":"The indicator is calculated at the national level.","references_documentation":"The National SDG Reporting Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan .github.io, http://www.stat.kg/ru/statistics/promyshlennost/","indicator_number":"7.2.1.1","target_number":"7.2","goal_number":"7","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"07-02-01-01"}
