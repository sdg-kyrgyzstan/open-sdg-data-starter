","concepts":"The population (population) is a naturally historically formed and continuously renewed collection of people in the process of production and reproduction of direct life. There are two categories of population accepted in the Kyrgyz Republic: cash and permanent.\nCash population - the population located in the given territory at the time of the census, including temporary residents.\nPermanent population - the population permanently residing in a given territory, including those temporarily absent at the time of the census. \nDuring the population and housing census of 2022, persons who are temporarily absent from their place of permanent (habitual) residence include those who, at the time of the population count, are outside the territory of the locality where they permanently live: those who have left for temporary or seasonal work, on a business trip, on vacation, on an industrial internship, visiting relatives, etc. acquaintances within or outside the Kyrgyz Republic, if their absence has not exceeded 1 year. \nLocalities are divided into urban and rural areas. Urban settlements include cities (of republican, regional, and district significance), urban-type settlements, and rural villages, regardless of their administrative subordination.\nA place of permanent (habitual) residence\" is a geographical location where the respondent usually spends his daily rest time during a certain period, including the time of the census. \"","rationale_interpretation":"Statistical data on the size and composition of the country's population is one of the most universal blocks of national information resources. The population acts, on the one hand, as a producer of all created national wealth, and on the other hand, it is a consumer of material and spiritual values. Users of population information include government and local government authorities, all groups of legal entities, the business community, scientific organizations, individuals, as well as international bodies.\nThe population is a momentary indicator, i.e. it always refers to a certain exact moment in time, it is obtained either as a result of population censuses or by calculation. In statistics, the population is usually given either on January 1 (estimate at the beginning of the year) or on December 31 (at the end of the year).","data_sources":"In the inter-census period, a current estimate of the permanent population is made - the calculation of the population based on census data, taking into account information from the current registration of demographic events.","data_collection":"\"The method of continuous accounting based on population census data and current population movement accounting based on information received from the State Institution \"Kyzmat\" under the Office of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic with a monthly frequency. \"","computation_methods":"A population estimate is an approximate determination of the number of inhabitants in a country or part of it, which is based on the results of the last population census, to which the numbers of those born and those who arrived in a given territory are added annually, and the numbers of those who died and those who left a given territory are subtracted. The total population is calculated for the republic as a whole and its individual administrative-territorial units (from data as of January 1 of this year to January 1 of the following year). At the same time, changes in the population as a result of administrative and territorial transformations are also taken into account.  \nFor various calculations during the calendar year, an estimate of the population of the territory is made at the beginning of each month, for which the results of natural movement and migration of the population are used.\n Current population estimates are calculated based on the results of the last population census, to which the number of births and arrivals in a given Territory is added annually, and from which the number of deaths and departures from a given territory is subtracted. Current estimates of the population over the past years are being updated based on the results of the next census. ","comments_limitations":"The most accurate data on the size and composition of the population and demographic processes is provided by the population census (conducted once every 10 years). In the inter-census period, a current estimate of the available population is made based on the census data and taking into account information from the current registration of demographic events.
