","data_sources":"Cause of death information is obtained from medical death certificates drawn up by doctors or mid-level medical personnel regarding disease, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences resulting in death. These documents, along with civil registration of deaths drawn up by civil registry offices (which are subordinate to the State Registration Service), are sent to statistical agencies for calculation.
