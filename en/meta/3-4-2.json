Among causes are diseases, pathological conditions or injuries that lead to or contribute to death, as well as accidents or acts of violence that cause fatal injuries.

Suicide rate is also used to assess public health and quality of treatment and preventive measures. ","data_sources":"Cause of death information is obtained from medical death certificates drawn up by doctors or mid-level medical personnel regarding disease, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences resulting in death. These documents, along with civil registration of deaths drawn up by civil registry offices (which are subordinate to the State Registration Service), are sent to statistical agencies for calculation. Of causes listed, one is selected for statistical purposes - the primary, i.e. the disease or injury that caused events directly leading to death.
