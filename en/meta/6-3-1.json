This accounting structure means that these activities cover the whole economy and are considered for each industry, which are defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC), and covering 1) abstraction and distribution of water, 2) discharge, reuse and treatment of wastewater, and 3) consumption and returns of water back to the environment, in this accounting structure, disaggregated by industry in a standardized way.

Although there are international guidelines and standards, their compliance by countries is not internationally binding. Countries can set their own standards which can vary from international norms and standards. For this reason, country data may not follow the international standard that JMP likes to follow for its global monitoring purposes.\nHaving said the above, using MDG experiences of data reconciliation, and working collabouratively with JMP on this will help reconciling definitional discrepancies and hence variations in estimates. This vast experience in dealing with such issues will be very useful in dealing with the above issues for the SDG period.\n","international_comparability":"Since this indicator is disaggregated for households and non-households (industrial and commercial establishments, as per the classification of ISIC Rev4); more can be found on the methods note: http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Methodological-note-on-monitoring-SDG-targets-for-WASH-and-wastewater_WHO-UNICEF_8October2015_Final.pdf.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator":"6.3.1","target_id":"6.3","sdg_goal":"6","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"06-03-01"}
