","concepts":"In order to calculate the proportion and the size of the country's population living below the national extreme poverty line, a welfare indicator (consumption expenditure) and an extreme poverty line indicator in value terms are required.\nThe extreme poverty line is the minimum income per person needed to meet minimum human nutritional needs of 2,100 kcal per day.\nHousehold consumption expenditures are monetary expenditures on non-food consumer goods and services, and the value of food consumption. ","rationale_interpretation":"The national extreme poverty line is used to assess the living standard of the population and to justify the need for targeted government support to poor and disadvantaged citizens in the Kyrgyz Republic.\nThe welfare indicator is calculated annually based on regularly collected data on expenditures and consumption of the population in the Kyrgyz Republic. The extreme poverty line is determined based on the revised social standards, changes in data collecting and processing methodology, when annual average inflation exceeds 10 percent. In subsequent years, the extreme poverty line is indexed annually based on the value of the consumer price index (period to period) for foodstuffs.","data_sources":"Integrated Sample Household Budget and Labour Force Survey (IHS).","data_collection":"Interviewers conduct the survey making direct visits to households and completing IHS questionnaires approved by the Kyrgyz Republic National Statistical Committee Resolution.
