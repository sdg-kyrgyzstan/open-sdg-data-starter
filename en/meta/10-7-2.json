The information collected seeks to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator also serves for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).\nPrinciples and objectives of the Migration Governance Framework:\n1. Adherence to international standards and fulfillment of migrant\u2019s rights.\n2. Evidence and whole of-government approaches to migration governance.\n3. Strong partnerships to support migration governance.\n\nThe three principles propose the necessary conditions for migration to be well-managed by creating a more effective environment for maximized results for migration to be beneficial to all. These represent the means through which a State can ensure that the systemic requirements for good migration governance are in place. \nThe three objectives are specific and do not require any further conventions, laws or practices than the ones that are already existing. Taken together, these objectives ensure that migration is governed in an integrated and holistic way, responding to the need to consider mobile categories of people and address their needs for assistance in the event of an emergency, building resilience of individuals and communities, as well as ensuring opportunities for the economic and social health of the State.","concepts":"SDG target 10.7 is broad in scope and many, but not all, of the terms are well defined. The IOM Glossary on Migration  provides a definition of key concepts such as orderly and regular migration, but not others such as safe and responsible migration. According to the Glossary, orderly migration refers to \u201cthe movement of a person from his/her usual place of residence, in keeping with the laws and regulations governing exit of the country of origin and travel, transit and entry into the host country\u201d. Regular is defined as \u201cmigration that occurs through recognized, legal channels\u201d. \n\nWhile the concept of \u201cwell-managed migration policies\u201d is not explicitly defined, according to the IOM Glossary, it is included in references to migration management, migration governance and facilitated migration. Migration management refers to the planned approach to the development of policy, and legislative and administrative responses to key migration issues. Migration governance is defined as a system of institutions, legal frameworks, mechanisms and practices aimed at regulating migration and protecting migrants. Facilitated migration refers to fostering or encouraging regular migration, for example through streamlined visa application process.","rationale_interpretation":"The time series is the result of an evaluation composed of 30 questions grouped in six domains. These six domains are:\n1. Migrant rights\n2. Whole-of-government/Evidence-based policies\n3. Cooperation and partnerships\n4. Socioeconomic well-being\n5. Mobility dimension of crises\n6. Safe, orderly and regular migration\n\nBased on the answers an overall score can be calculated across all six domains. Categories of the\noverall score are:\n\u2022 Values of less than 40 are coded as \u201cRequires further progress\u201d = 1 Point\n\u2022 Values of 40 to less than 80 are coded as \u201cPartially meets\u201d = 2 Points\n\u2022 Values of 80 to less than 100 are coded as \u201cMeets\u201d = 3 Points\n\u2022 Values of 100 are coded as \u201cFully meets\u201d = 4 Points","data_sources":"The source of data is the UN Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development, which has been used to survey global population policies since 1963, including policies on international migration. The Inquiry is mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 1838 (XVII) of 18 December 1962. The Inquiry consists mostly of multiple-choice questions. \n\nTwo successive rounds of the Inquiry have been used to collect data on indicator 10.7.2: the Twelfth Inquiry, conducted between September 2018 and October 2019, and the Thirteenth Inquiry, conducted between November 2020 and October of 2021. The Twelfth Inquiry is divided into three thematic modules: Module I on population ageing and urbanization; Module II on fertility, family planning and reproductive health; and Module III on international migration. Module III of the Twelfth Inquiry has been updated to include core questions for all the six migration policy domains mentioned above. The Thirteenth Inquiry is divided into two thematic modules: Module I on reproductive health; and Module II on international migration.","data_collection":"The Inquiry is conducted on behalf of the Secretary-General and is sent to all Permanent Missions in New York: 193 Member States, 2 observer States, and 2 non-member States. As per past practice, the Permanent Missions redirect the three thematic modules of the Inquiry to the relevant line ministries or government departments who are tasked with answering the questions. The Inquiry modules can be completed either through an online questionnaire or a fillable questionnaire in PDF. Countries responses are transmitted back to UN DESA for basic consistency checking. The data are then compiled/integrated into the World Population Policies database. The results of the Inquiry are disseminated though the database, updated every two years. \n\nAs part of the collaboration on SDG indicator 10.7.2, IOM assisted in garnering country responses to the international migration module of the Inquiry by following up through its respective country or regional counterparts. OECD, as partner agency for this indicator, supported these efforts for its member countries. The collaboration increased response rates from countries and improved the quality of the data. \n\nThe data were collected biennially between 2019 and 2021, to ensure that there is sufficient information to monitor progress in the achievement of the target. In the future, the periodicity of the Inquiry will be modified to quadrennial. This will also allow for gathering benchmark data once within each HLPF 4-year cycle.\n\nNo adjustments to standard classifications are envisioned. ","computation_methods":"The indicator includes a total of 30 sub-categories, under 6 questions/domains. All sub-categories, except for those under domain 1, have dichotomous \u201cYes/No\u201d answers, coded \u201c1\u201d for \u201cYes\u201d and \u201c0\u201d for \u201cNo\u201d. For the sub-categories under domain 1, there are three possible answers: \u201cYes, regardless of immigration status\u201d, coded \u201c1\u201d; \u201cYes, only for those with legal immigration status\u201d, coded \u201c0.5\u201d; and \u201cNo\u201d coded \u201c0\u201d.\n\nFor each domain, the computational methodology is the unweighted average of the values across sub-categories :\n\nD_i  =  (\u2211_j^n\u2592s_ji )/n  \u00d7100\n\nWhere D_i refers to the value for domain i;\u2211_j^n\u2592s_ji  refers to the sum of the values across sub-categories (indexed by j) under domain i; and n refers to the total number of sub-categories in a domain (n=5). Results are reported as percentages. For each domain, values of D_i range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 per cent.\n\nThe overall summary indicator 10.7.2 for a country is obtained by computing the unweighted average of the values of the 30 sub-categories under the six domains, with values ranging between 0 and 100 per cent. \n\nFor ease of interpretation and to summarize results, the resulting country-level averages (for the overall indicator and by domain) are then categorized as follows: values of less than 40 are coded as \u201cRequires further progress\u201d; values of 40 to less than 80 are coded as \u201cPartially meets\u201d, values of 80 to less than 100 are coded as \u201cMeets\u201d; and values of 100 are coded as \u201cFully meets\u201d.
