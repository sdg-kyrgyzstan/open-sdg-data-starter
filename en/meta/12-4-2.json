Hazardous waste (other than radioactive waste) contain any hazardous substances (such as toxic, infectious, explosive, flammable, highly reactive) in a quantity and in a form to pose an immediate or potential danger to human health or environment, either alone or in contact with others.","concepts":"In accordance with the Kyrgyz Law on Production and Consumption Wastes, all hazardous wastes are divided into classes based on their harmful effect on humans and the environment. Production and consumption wastes are divided into five hazard classes: first class - substances (wastes) are extra-hazardous, second class - substances (wastes) are highly hazardous, third class - substances (wastes) are moderately hazardous, fourth class - substances (wastes) are low hazardous, fifth class - substances (wastes) are virtually non-hazardous.","rationale_interpretation":"\u0430) Global level \u2013 State parties to the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal have agreed to take all possible measures to ensure and minimize hazardous and other (including domestic) waste generation.
