Hazardous waste (other than radioactive waste) contain any hazardous substances (such as toxic, infectious, explosive, flammable, highly reactive) in a quantity and in a form to pose an immediate or potential danger to human health or environment, either alone or in contact with others.","concepts":"In accordance with the Kyrgyz Law on Production and Consumption Wastes, all hazardous wastes are divided into classes based on their harmful effect on humans and the environment. Production and consumption wastes are divided into five hazard classes: first class - substances (wastes) are extra-hazardous, second class - substances (wastes) are highly hazardous, third class - substances (wastes) are moderately hazardous, fourth class - substances (wastes) are low hazardous, fifth class - substances (wastes) are virtually non-hazardous.","rationale_interpretation":"\u0430) Global level \u2013 State parties to the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal have agreed to take all possible measures to ensure and minimize hazardous and other (including domestic) waste generation.

The EU Waste Framework Directive provides for increased efforts to prevent and reduce waste generation, ensure waste management and develop new waste disposal methods.","data_sources":"The data are collected by the NSC according to the national statistical reporting format No. 1 \u2013 Wastes - Reports on Production and Consumption Waste Generation and Management\" (annual reporting)","data_collection":"Statistical reporting is submitted by all economic entities, regardless of their form of ownership, which conduct activities in the field of production and consumption waste management, as well as enterprises and organizations generating, disposing toxic industrial wastes, and reporting to the territorial statistical bodies at their location.","computation_methods":"Ratio of generated production and consumption waste of 1-3 hazard classes to average annual number of population, kilograms per person.
