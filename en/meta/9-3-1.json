The term \u00abgross\u00bb indicates that indicator includes the value of fixed capital used in the production process.","rationale_interpretation":"Small-scale industry statistics examine the quantitative aspects of operations and development of small business entities in relationship to quality. Small-industry statistics collect and process statistical indicators to analyze financial and economic activities of small business entities of all types of activities, including small industrial enterprises, macro-economic analysis and system of national accounts. A small-scale industry is one of the key elements of the market structure. Establishing small enterprises is a prerequisite for competitive environment, job creation and bringing in new goods and services. Small enterprises are better suited than large and medium-sized enterprises to respond quickly to market changes diversify production and innovate. Development of statistical methodology requires a clear identification of economic entities.\nSmall-scale industry entities are private and legal persons registered in accordance with procedures established by law and exercising at their own risk and under their property liability activities not prohibited by law, irrespective of their organizational and legal forms and forms of ownership.","data_sources":"National Statistical Committee collects, processes and calculates the data.","data_collection":"Indicator calculated using sectoral statistics.
