The electric capacity indicator indicates the general relationship between the consumption of electric energy and the economic development of the republic. In the Kyrgyz Republic, more than 90% of all electricity generated is produced at hydroelectric power plants using water energy and as a result of economic growth is almost minimal.","concepts":"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the most important indicator of national accounts, characterizing the state and development of the economy and economic growth trends of the Kyrgyz Republic over a certain period.  It reflects the value of goods and services produced in a country and intended for final consumption, accumulation and export.","rationale_interpretation":"The rate of decrease in the electrical consumption of GDP indicates the effectiveness of the state's energy-saving policy. Indicators of the electrical intensity of GDP in individual sectors characterize indicators of the sustainable development of the sector and the general relationship between electricity consumption and the economic development of this sector of the economy.","data_sources":"Data collection, processing and calculation are carried out by the National Statistical Committee.","data_collection":"The indicator is calculated, which uses data from industry statistics. Frequency: annual.","computation_methods":"Electrical capacity of GDP is electricity consumption (kWh) divided by GDP (million soms, current and comparable prices).                                 The electrical capacity of certain types of economic activity is the amount of electricity consumed by the corresponding types of activity (kW.h) to the output (volume of production) of products of the relevant types of activities (million soms).","comments_limitations":"Electrical capacity is just an imperfect proxy indicator of energy efficiency. It can be influenced by a number of factors such as climate, economic structure, the nature of economic activity, etc., which are not necessarily related to pure efficiency.One of the most important parameters determining the energy efficiency of a national economy is energy consumption per capita and the energy intensity of the gross domestic product. Electrical consumption (energy intensity) characterizes the share of costs of all electrical resources in the production of a certain type of product.
