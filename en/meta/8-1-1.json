Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries","indicator_name1":"8.1.1.

It measures the monetary value of final goods and services produced in the country for final consumption, accumulation and export.\nActual population is population residing in the country at the time of registration, regardless of the place of residence.","rationale_interpretation":"GDP per capita measures the standard of living of country\u2019s population and determines contributions to international organizations.\nGDP per capita production in monetary equivalent is calculated in KG soms and US dollars (at the official NBKR rate).  ","data_sources":"The National Statistical Committee collects, processes and calculates data by using statistical reporting forms and sample surveys","data_collection":"Indicator calculated using sectoral statistics. Frequency: quarterly, annual.","computation_methods":"GDP per capita is the ratio of the total gross domestic product produced over a period of time to the number of people.\nGDPPC=GDP/P \nwhere, \nGDPPC \u2013 GDP per capita;\nGDP \u2013 nominal GDP; \nP \u2013 actual population.\nThe annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows:\na. Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2010 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2010 prices using the 2010 exchange rates.\nb. Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2010 prices.\nc. Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+ 1 using the following formula:\n   G(t+1) \u2013 G(t)\n--------------------*100\n       G(t),\n\nwhere G(t+1) is real GDP per capita in 2010 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real GDP per capita in 2010 US dollars in year t","comments_limitations":"Per capita GDP is one of the key factors determining country\u2019s economic development, since it allows estimating growth rates of countries by population size.\nA positive change in this indicator can be interpreted as an increase in the average standard of living of the residents in a country. Value-added production growth is the basic determinant of functioning of the economy. By distributing total output per unit of population, it is possible to measure development impact of output growth rates per person. The indicator can, in fact, be considered as an aggregate indicator of socio-economic development.","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of recorded data is carried out.","data_availability_gaps":"Time series have been available since 1993. \nData are published in various NSC publications and its website.","disaggregation":"By economic activity types and regions of the Kyrgyz Republic  ","international_comparability":"Currently calculated using the 1993 SNA methodology, which makes the indicator not fully comparable with data from countries using 2008 SNA.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator":"8.1.1","target_id":"8.1","sdg_goal":"8","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"08-01-01"}
