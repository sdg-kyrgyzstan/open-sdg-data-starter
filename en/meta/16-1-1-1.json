Causes of death are diseases, pathological conditions, or injuries that led to or contributed to death, as well as the circumstances of an accident or act of violence that caused a fatal injury.

Premeditated murders occur in all countries of the world, this indicator has a global scale. \nIt is necessary to monitor premeditated murders in order to better understand their causes, intentions and consequences and, in the long term, develop effective preventive measures.
