Among causes are diseases, pathological conditions or injuries that lead to or contribute to death, as well as accidents or acts of violence that cause fatal injuries. Cause of death has been coded since 2000. Based on the World Health Organization 10 Revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10). ","rationale_interpretation":"Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population.","data_sources":"Cause of death information is obtained from medical death certificates drawn up by doctors or mid-level medical personnel on disease, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences resulting in death. These documents, along with civil registration of deaths are sent to statistical agencies for calculation.","data_collection":"Mortality data are obtained from the annual statistical compilation of official records of deaths drawn up by the civil registration offices (The Civil Registration Office of the State Registration Service under GKR). Aggregated data are collected and processed by the regional statistical offices and the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.","computation_methods":"Mortality rates by causes of death are the ratio of deaths from these causes to the annual average population as currently estimated. Calculated per 100,000 population.","comments_limitations":"Get acquainted with coding rules for the primary cause of death and definitions set out in the revised International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). In case of difficulties with diagnosis, contact staff of the E-Health Center of the Ministry of Health to consult for the final diagnosis.","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of recorded data is carried out. Data control in data records is carried out by logical control procedure embedded in the data input and processing software. The causes of death codes are checked along diagnoses recorded in death report, according to ICD-10, and results tables are analyzed for causes of death.","data_availability_gaps":"Data on deaths from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms (cancer) are published in the statistical compendium \"Demographic Yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\", and on the National Statistical Committee\u2019s website. Time series have been available since 1990.","disaggregation":"Territorial data aggregation: country, region, district.\nData aggregation by sex: total, men, women.","international_comparability":"International definition of the indicator is used for national statistics. Data coding and compilation on deaths by cause of death is done by state statistics authorities in accordance with the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death (ICD-10), since 2000 report. By agreement with the National Statistical Committee, database on mortality is submitted to the Centre for Electronic Health of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic: Form 2 \u00abInformation on the number of births, marriages, divorces and deaths by cause of death\u00bb is submitted monthly, with a delay of 1.5 months from the reporting month and form C52 \u00abPopulation mortality by cause of death\u00bb submitted annually, in June following the reporting year.","references_documentation":"References to RLA and methodology: \nhttp://www.stat.kg/ru/about/pravovye-osnovy-organov-gosudarstvennoj-statistiki/; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/Metadata; http://www.stat.kg/ru/statistics/download/methodology/68/. \nNational Statistical Committee publications: \u00abSocial economic situation of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb monthly report, statistical collections: \u00abStatistical Yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\u201d, \u00abDemographic yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abSocial trends of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abWomen and men of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abHealth of population and healthcare in the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb available on the official website of NSC KR: http://www.stat.kg/ru/publications/\nKR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator":"3.4.1","target_id":"3.4","sdg_goal":"3","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"03-04-01"}
