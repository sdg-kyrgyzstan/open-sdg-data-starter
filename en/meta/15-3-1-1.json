Agricultural crop acreage is the area occupied by crops by the end of sowing of spring crops. An unused arable land is an area where no work is carried out on the arable land for cultivating crops and cultivating the soil.","concepts":"Agricultural lands are of particular importance as a means of producing agricultural products.The involvement of unused arable agricultural land in agricultural turnover is an important strategic task for all participants in agricultural production.  Unused arable land is formed at the aiyl okmotu level, which allows you to determine unused arable land and the reasons for not using it. Taken in dynamics, the data of unused arable land reveal a trend of change in the structure of agricultural crops.","rationale_interpretation":"The purpose of developing the unused arable land indicator is to provide the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic with the necessary and reliable information on the size of agricultural crops and on the use of arable land.","data_sources":"The sources of information for calculating the unused arable land indicator are: form No. 4-CX \"Report on the results of sowing for the harvest of 202_g.\" Section 2.
