","concepts":"Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015).","rationale_interpretation":"This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a prerequisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability.\nMonitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS 2015), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime).","data_sources":"The source of information on death causes are based on medical records issued by a doctor or paramedic regarding illness, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences that caused the death.

Calculated per 100,000 population.","comments_limitations":"The ICCS 2015 provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide:\n- Murder\n- Honour killing\n- Serious assault leading to death\n- Death as a result of terrorist activities\n- Dowry-related killings\n- Femicide\n- Infanticide\n- Voluntary manslaughter\n- Extrajudicial killings\n- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials. \nFurthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes.","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of the reported data is performed.
