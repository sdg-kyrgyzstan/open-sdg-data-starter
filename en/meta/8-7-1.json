Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age","organization_name":" National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (Household Statistics Division)","contact_name":"Kerimalieva N.K.","contact_email":"Sdg_nsc@stat.kg ","contact_phone":"(0312) 32 46 91","organization_website":"www.stat.kg","definitions":"The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey).","concepts":"The term child labour refers to the subset of children\u2019s activities that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children and that should be targeted for elimination. Child labour is a legal concept rather than a statistical one, and the international legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child labour statistics. The three principal international conventions on child labour \u2013 ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182), and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it.\nIn December 2008, the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) adopted the Resolution concerning statistics of child labour. This Resolution helps in translating the legal standards governing child labour into statistical terms. In particular, the Resolution is designed to set standards for the collection, compilation and analysis of national child labour statistics, and to guide countries in updating their existing statistical system in this field.\nIn accordance with the Resolution, and on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), child labour is defined for measurement purposes to include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period: \n\u2022 hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 21 to 32); \n\u2022 worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 33 to 34); and \n\u2022 employment below the minimum working age, excluding, where applicable, \u201clight work\u201d, performed by children aged not less than 12 or 13 years (18th ICLS, paragraphs 35 to 37).","rationale_interpretation":"Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future. According to the latest ILO global estimates, about 168 million children worldwide are child labourers, accounting for almost 11 percent of the child population.","data_sources":"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)","data_collection":"ComputerAssisted Personal Interview (CAPI) have been used for surveys. The application for data collection, including a special CAPI data management platform, is based on CSPro (Census and Survey Processing System) version 6.3. Procedures and standard software developed under the global CAPI programme were adapted to the final version of the 2018 CAPI questionnaire for Kyrgyzstan and used in the survey.","computation_methods":"The measurement methodology used by the ILO in its global estimates on child labour, building on the ICLS statistical definition, classifies child labour on the basis of the following criteria:\n\u2022 Ages 5 to 11: at least 1 hour of economic activity per week;\n\u2022 Ages 12 to 14: at least 14 hour of economic activity per week in all forms of economic activity except permissible \u201clight\u201d work, where light work is operationally defined as economic activity that (i) does not exceed 14 hours per week and that (ii) is not hazardous in nature; and\n\u2022 Ages 15 to 17: work in designated hazardous industries, or in designated hazardous occupations, or for long hours. Long hours are defined as 43 or more hours during the reference week.\nThe proportion of children in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the population. For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17.\n\nChildren aged 5-17: Number of children aged 5-17 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.\n\nChildren aged 5-14: Number of children aged 5-14 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-14 in the population, multiplied by 100.\n\nChildren aged 15-17: Number of children aged 15-17 reported child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 15-17 in the population, multiplied by 100.","comments_limitations":"Child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ","data_availability_gaps":"Nationally representative and comparable data are currently available for 102 countries, including Kyrgyz Republic.","disaggregation":"Disaggregation by sex and age group (age groups 5-14 and 15-17).","international_comparability":"ILO Convention \u2116138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application). This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries.
