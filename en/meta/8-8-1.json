It is a measure of the risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury based on the duration of exposure to adverse work-related factors.\nCase of fatal occupational injury: the case of a worker fatally injured as a result of one occupational accident, and where death occurred within one year of the day of the accident.","concepts":"Occupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer.\nCase of fatal occupational injury: the case of a worker fatally injured as a result of one occupational accident, and where death occurred within one year of the day of the accident.","rationale_interpretation":"This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and economic activities whit the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and\nreveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers\u2019 organizations, workers and workers\u2019 organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers\u2019 organizations, workers and workers\u2019 organizations to introduce accident prevention measures.","data_sources":"Data for calculation of this indicator are obtained from the annual statistical reporting form 7-TBH \u00abReport on Occupational Injuries, Diseases and Related Material Costs\u00bb, produced annually both for the country and by regions.","data_collection":"Enterprises, institutions and organizations, regardless of organizational and legal form, ownership or subordination, submit reports. \nData on occupational accidents are included in reports.","computation_methods":"The following indicators are used to calculate occupational injuries: \n \nFOI   =  P  *  1000 / NE \n \nwhere  FOI \u2013 Frequency of occupational injuries; \nP \u2013 Number of occupational accidents with disabilities per day or more, including  fatal cases;     \nNE \u2013 Average number of employees.","comments_limitations":"There may be problems of under reporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities.","data_availability_gaps":"www.ibo.org/ilostat","disaggregation":"Disaggregated by occupational and fatal cases by region and sex.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io\nwww.uis.unesco.org\nLaw of the Kyrgyz Republic of 1 August 2003 \u2116167 \u00abOn labour protection\u00bb; Decree of the GKR \u00ab Regulations on Recording and Investigating Occupational Accidents\u00bb of 27 February 2001 \u211664;","indicator":"8.8.1","target_id":"8.8","sdg_goal":"8","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"08-08-01"}
