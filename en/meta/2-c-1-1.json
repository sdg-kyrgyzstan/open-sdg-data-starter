The CPI measures the ratio of the value of a fixed set of goods and services at current period prices to its value at prices of the previous (base) period.This indicator is one of the main inflation measures, based on the comparison of the prices of a basket of key consumer goods weighted according to their share in total consumption.","concepts":"The Price Index is a relative indicator expressed as a coefficient or percentage that characterizes price changes over time (dynamic index) or across regions (spatial index).\n\nIndividual price index is the ratio of the price of a particular good or service in the reporting period to its price in the base period.\n\nGroup price index is the weighted average of all individual price indices for a specific group or subgroup of goods and services.\n\nOverall price index is the weighted average of all group indices and reflects the general change in prices for the selected goods or services.\nA fixed consumer basket is a unified list of goods and paid services most frequently consumed by the population, selected uniformly for all regions of the Kyrgyz Republic.\nA representative good/service is defined as a set of distinguishing characteristics of a product or service that are homogeneous in terms of consumer purpose.\nA price (tariff) is the monetary expression of the value of a good or service.\nConsumer (retail) price (tariff) is the actual price or tariff at which goods and services are sold to the population at retail, including through shops, markets, stalls, and kiosks.
