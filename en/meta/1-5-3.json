Increasing number of national governments that adopt and implement national and local DRR strategies, which the Sendai Framework calls for, will contribute to sustainable development from economic, environmental and social perspectives.

Further to the deliberations of the OEIWG as well as the IAEG, UNISDR has proposed computation methodologies that allow the monitoring of improvement in national and local DRR strategies over time. These methodologies range from a simple quantitative assessment of the number of these strategies to a qualitative measure of alignment with the Sendai Framework, as well as population coverage for local strategies.","data_sources":"National Progress Report of the Sendai Monitor, reported to UNISDR.","data_collection":"Official national partners submit National Progress Report of the Sendai Monitor.","computation_methods":"Technical%20Collection%20of%20Concept%20Notes%20on%20Indicators.pdf\nNote: Computation methodology for several indicators is very comprehensive, very long (about 180 pages) and probably out of the scope of this Metadata.
