Based on the World Health Organization 10 Revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10).","rationale_interpretation":"The indicator analysis allows assessing State policy effectiveness of in the area of maternal and child protection in the country, since the level of medical care for pregnant women and mothers determines health of future generations. Maternal mortality rates in Kyrgyzstan, although decreasing slightly over the years, remain high. The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy is considered to be a maternal death. Thus, if the deceased was pregnant (irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy) or died within 42 days after giving birth, the medical death certificate must include an indication of the pregnancy period or post-natal period, even if pregnancy was not related to the main cause of death.","data_sources":"Cause of death information is obtained from medical death certificates drawn up by medics or paramedics on disease, accident, homicide, suicide and other external influences resulting in death. These documents, along with civil registration of deaths drawn up by civil registry offices (which are subordinate to the State Registration Service), are sent to statistical agencies for calculation. Of causes listed, one is selected for statistical purposes - the primary, i.e. the disease or injury that caused events directly leading to death.","data_collection":"Data are obtained from Death Certificates and attached to them Medical Death Certificates submitted by the Civil Registry Office (SRS under the GKR) on a regular basis (monthly).\nPrimary processing and data consolidation are carried out at the level of local government statistical agencies. The national data set is processed by the National Statistical Committee. The period between data collection and submission is 38 days.","computation_methods":"Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.\nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.","comments_limitations":"This indicator reflects maternal mortality risks in relation to the number of children born alive and essentially records the risk of death from pregnancy or live birth. According to experts, coverage of civil registration system is considered satisfactory though needs to be improved due to being paper-based. Since December 2014 an automated electronic system AIS \"Registration Office\" has been in operation as a component of SRS information systems. However, upon receipt by statistical authorities paper-based data then entered into special software by statistical agencies employees, which sometimes leads to errors and omissions. Soon (until the end of 2020th) a database on natural and migratory population movements being derived from the SRS data will become one of population statistics sources.","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of recorded data is carried out. Data control in data records is carried out by logical control procedure embedded in the data input and processing software. The causes of death codes are checked along diagnoses recorded in death report, according to ICD-10, and results tables are analyzed for causes of death.","data_availability_gaps":"Data are distributed via the National Statistical Committee publications: \u00abSocial economic situation of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb monthly report, statistical collections: \u00abDemographic yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abSocial trends of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abWomen and men of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abHealth of  population and healthcare in the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abYoung people in KR\u00bb available on the official website of NSC KR: http://www.stat.kg/ru/publications/ Time series have been available since 1990.","disaggregation":"Indicator is calculated nationally and by regions (Republic, regions, city of Bishkek, city of Osh).","international_comparability":"International definition of the indicator is used for national statistics. Data coding and compilation on deaths by cause of death is done by state statistics authorities in accordance with the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death (ICD-10), since 2000 report.
