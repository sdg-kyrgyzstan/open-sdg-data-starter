The balance data dynamics allow to identify nutrition trends of the population.  ","rationale_interpretation":"The goal of developing food balances is to provide the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic with necessary and reliable information about the production volumes of products and articles of their use.","data_sources":"Balance sheets are prepared by the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic only at the national level per calendar year in kind. Since data on food balance sheets are macroeconomic indicators, expert estimates are allowed for export in determining the consumption of individual agricultural products for production purposes (expenditure on seeds, feed). The costs of losses and year-end inventories of selected agricultural products are calculated using the distribution factors obtained from the sample survey results for the full range of economic entities engaged in agricultural production.","data_collection":"The balance sheet contains data on both finished and processed products converted to main agricultural production by coefficients.
