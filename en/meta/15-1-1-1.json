The indicator characterizes the area of forests, its ratio to the area of the country, as well as the percentage of the area covered by forests.

The indicator provides an assessment of the state of forests or forested lands in the country, as well as shows trends in their use. Forests are the only natural sink of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the excess of which leads to global warming.
