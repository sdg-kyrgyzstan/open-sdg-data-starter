However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor do we know if those activities were undertaken effectively.","disaggregation":"Age, place of residence, geographical location, education and other background characteristics of respondent.","international_comparability":"Although the indicator is based on internationally agreed definitions and methodology, one of the main issues is that measurement) (???) unlike ITU does not include programming.","references_documentation":"KR National SDG Reporting Platform:\n https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io\ndata.unicef.org,  http://www.uis.unesco.org/Pages/default.aspx\nMultiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2018 http://www.stat.kg/media/files/d0f77c65-07d9-469d-879a-84dc5aae8833.pdf.","indicator_number":"4.4.1","target_number":"4.4","goal_number":"4","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"04-04-01"}
