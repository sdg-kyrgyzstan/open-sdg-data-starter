This indicator allows you to determine the risk of negative effects of poor-quality drinking water on human health, and also characterizes the degree of compliance of drinking water with national sanitary requirements and standards.Public access to clean drinking water is of paramount importance in reducing the risk of exposure to polluted waters, and in particular the possibility of infection and related diseases. Additionally, the relationship of this indicator with other socio-economic characteristics, as well as its contribution to assessing the level of general hygiene and quality of life, make it a universal indicator of human development.","data_sources":"The NSC calculates the proportion of water samples that do not meet hygienic standards (Sanitary condition of water bodies in places of public water use) according to the data provided by the Ministry of Health's DPGSEN based on the state statistical Reporting form No. 18 \"Report on the work of the Center for State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance.\"","data_collection":"\"The Department of Disease Prevention and State Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic monitors the quality of drinking water on both urban, regional and national scales.

The indicator is calculated based on the available number of drinking water samples that do not meet national quality standards in relation to the total number of drinking water samples.
