The index \"Personal perception of the level of corruption\" allows us to identify a person's personal perception of the level of corruption in state executive authorities and local governments. ","concepts":"IND is a generalized indicator of the dynamics of changes in mass attitudes of society, reflecting the attitude of the population towards the activities of state executive authorities, mayors of Bishkek and Osh, authorized representatives of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic in the regions and heads of local state administrations - akims of districts (hereinafter referred to as state bodies and local governments).","rationale_interpretation":"The purpose of measuring the \"Population Confidence Index\" is an up-to-date assessment of the degree of public confidence in the activities of government agencies and local governments.","data_sources":"Data collection and calculation is carried out by the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic 2 times a year.","data_collection":"The index \"Personal perception of the level of corruption\" is based on regular surveys of residents aged 18 to 75 who are citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic, based on a standard representative sample, with a sampling error of 5-7 percent (or with a confidence interval of 0.05-0.07).                                          To measure the Index \"Personal perception of the level of corruption\" on a national scale, a sample survey of the population of 7 regions and the cities of Bishkek and Osh is conducted. The sample is 3,600 people, with a margin of sampling error of +/- 5 percent (400 people in each administrative-territorial unit).","computation_methods":"According to the index, its generalized value is constructed as the difference between the proportions of \"positive\" and \"negative\" responses, while extremely \"positive\"/\"negative\" responses are taken, respectively, with a weight of +1\"/\"-1\", and relatively \"positive\"/\"negative\" responses are taken, respectively, with a weight of \"+0.5\"/\"-0.5\".                                                              The index varies from \"+100\" to \"-100\". Index values of more than \"0\" indicate the predominance of \"positive\" assessments in public opinion, while index values of less than \"0\" indicate \"negative\" assessments by government agencies and local governments.","quality_assurance":"The questionnaire data to be collected during the interview is carried out in the following sequence:                                          - generalization of homogeneous and heterogeneous characteristics;\n- determination of indicators (average values);\n- comparison and comparison with other data (statistical, conclusions and results of other studies, etc.).
