Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable ","target_name":"11.2.

The access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is accessible within a distance of 0.5 km from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:\na. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.\nb. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times\nc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment","concepts":"Public transport is defined as a shared passenger transport service that is available to the general public. It includes cars, buses, trolleys, trams, trains, subways, and ferries that are shared by strangers without prior arrangement. However, it excludes taxis, car pools, and hired buses, which are not shared by strangers without prior arrangement. It also excludes informal, unregulated modes of transport (paratransit), motorcycle taxis, three-wheelers, etc.\nPublic transport refers to a public service that is considered as a public good that has well designed \u2018stops\u2019 for passengers to embark and disembark in a safe manner and demarcated \u2018routes\u2019 that are both officially and/or formally recognized.","rationale_interpretation":"This indicator aims to successfully monitor the use of and access to the public transportation system and the move towards easing the reliance on the private means of transportation, improving the access to areas with a high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, physically challenged individuals, and low income earners or areas with specific dwelling types such as high occupancy buildings or public housing and reducing the need for mobility by decreasing the number of trips and the distances travelled. The accessibility based urban mobility paradigm also critically needs good, high-capacity public transport systems that are well integrated in a multimodal arrangement with\npublic transport access points located within comfortable walking or cycling distances from homes and jobs for all.\nThe ability of residents including persons with disabilities and businesses to access markets, employment opportunities, and service centers such as schools and hospitals is critical to urban economic development. The transport system provides access to resources and employment opportunity. Moreover, accessibility allows planners to measure the effects of changes in transport and land use systems. The accessibility of jobs, services and markets also allow policymakers, citizens and businesses to discuss the state of the transport system in the comprehensible way. The transportation system is a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion.
