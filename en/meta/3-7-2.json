The adolescent birth rate represents the risk of childbearing among females in the particular age group. The adolescent birth rate among women aged 15-19 years is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.","rationale_interpretation":"The indicator analysis allows assessing State policy effectiveness of in the area of maternal and child protection in the country, since the level of medical care for pregnant women and mothers determines health of future generations. Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socioeconomic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services. ","data_sources":"Data is obtained from the civil registration system, which regularly records births and deaths in population. These documents, along with civil registration papers drawn up by civil registration offices (which are subordinate to the State Registration Service under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic), are sent to statistical agencies for calculation.","data_collection":"Data are collected from the submitted birth records submitted to the SRS under the GKR on a regular basis. Data on births by age of mother are obtained from civil registration systems covering 90 per cent or more of all live births and are eventually supplemented by census or survey estimates for periods when registration data have not been available.\nPrimary processing and data consolidation on newly born children are carried out at the level of local government statistical agencies. The national data set is processed by the National Statistical Committee.","computation_methods":"The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio of live births to women aged 15-19 years to average annual number of women aged 15-19 years per 1,000 females in the respective age group.","comments_limitations":"According to experts, coverage of civil registration system is considered satisfactory though needs to be improved due to being paper-based. Since December 2014 an automated electronic system AIS \"Registration Office\"(ZAGS) has been in operation as a component of SRS information systems. However, upon receipt by statistical authorities paper-based data then entered into special software by statistical agencies employees, which sometimes leads to errors and omissions. Soon (until the end of 2020) a database on natural and migratory population movements being derived from the SRS data will become one of population statistics sources.","quality_assurance":"Logical and arithmetic control of recorded data is carried out. Data control in data records is carried out by logical control procedure embedded in the data input and processing software. ","data_availability_gaps":"Data are distributed in NSC statistical publications: statistical collections \u00abStatistical Yearbook of KR\u00bb, \u00abSocial trends of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, thematic collections \u00abDemographic Yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00ab Women and men in the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00ab Health of the population and Health Care in the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abYouth in KR\u00bb.

Birth rate data are provided annually by the National Statistical Committee after 15 March.","international_comparability":"International definition of the indicator is used for national statistics. Since 2004 WHO criteria have been introduced in Kyrgyzstan, following which newborns with body weight of 500g and above and pregnancy of 22 weeks or more are subject to registration. Children are registered based on medical birth certificate (Form 103/Ministry of Health) and a birth declaration made in writing by parents or one of them (in cases when parents are unable to declare the birth in person, this declaration may be made by relatives or administration of the medical organization where birth occurred). A medical certificate of birth is issued by a maternity hospital or hospital which has established the fact and time of birth.","references_documentation":"References to RLA and methodology: \nhttp://www.stat.kg/ru/about/pravovye-osnovy-organov-gosudarstvennoj-statistiki/; https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/Metadata; http://www.stat.kg/ru/statistics/download/methodology/68/. \nNational Statistical Committee publications: \u00abSocial economic situation of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb monthly report, statistical collections: \u00abDemographic yearbook of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abSocial trends of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abWomen and men of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abThe standard of living of the population of the Kyrgyz Republic\u00bb, \u00abHealth of population and healthcare in the Kyrgyz Republic available on the official website of NSC KR: http://www.stat.kg/ru/publications/","indicator":"3.7.2","target_id":"3.7","sdg_goal":"3","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-02"}
