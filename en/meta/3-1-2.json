","concepts":"WHO defines childbirth is a normal physiological process that can occur without complications for most women and children born. Skilled health personnel are only those trained and have equipment and medicines at their disposal. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.\nSkilled childbirth assistance is provided by doctors, nurses or midwifes.","rationale_interpretation":"Analyzing this indicator along with other indicators, makes it possible to assess effectiveness of preventive measures, work of local health authorities to protect mothers and children and to develop a number of specific measures to improve health of women during pregnancies and children.\nHaving a skilled attendant at the time of delivery is an important lifesaving intervention for both mothers and babies. Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women's health and gender empowerment because it could cause the death of the mother or long lasting disability, especially in marginalized (distanced) settings.","data_sources":"Data for this indicator are obtained from administrative data of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic.
