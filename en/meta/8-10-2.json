In addition, it includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months.

As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion.","data_availability_gaps":"The indicators in the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more than 140 economies representing more than 97 percent of the world\u2019s population. The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its\nGallup World Poll, which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples.
