These functions require higher education. Researchers can also include administrative and managerial staff directly managing research process (including heads of R&D institutions and units) as well as postgraduate students directly involved in research.\nResident population is actual population, including those temporarily absent, at the time of census. During the inter-census period, resident population is regularly assessed based on census data and current registration of demographic events.","rationale_interpretation":"The indicator is a direct measure of the number of research and development workers per 1 million people.","data_sources":"Data obtained from the State statistical form \u21161-science \u00abReport of organization(s) on scientific and technical works\u00bb, population statistics of the Kyrgyz Republic","data_collection":"Legal entities and their structural units performing scientific research and development activities annually submit form \u21161-science to local state statistical agency","computation_methods":"Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants determined by number of researchers engaged in R&D to the total resident population.\n\nIndicator is calculated by:\ny = n / N * 1000000 , where \nn = researchers engaged in R&D,\nN = total resident population.","comments_limitations":"Research and development (R&D) data need to be collected through surveys, which are expensive, and are not done on a regular basis in many developing countries.
