Differences between country produced and international estimates are mainly due to differences between coverage estimates from administrative system and survey results. In case the vaccine is not included in national immunization schedule the coverage from private sector will not be reflected.","data_availability_gaps":"Coverage data for different vaccines are collected annually and reviewed by WHO and UNICEF inter agency expert group and estimates made for each country and each year.
