T","concepts":"State budget expenditures include all non-recoverable payments, whether they are reimbursable (i.e. paid in exchange for something) or not, and for what purpose - operational activities or acquisition of non-financial assets.\nGovernment expenditure on agriculture includes: sectoral policies and programmes, soil improvement and control of soil degradation, irrigation and water supply for agricultural use, animal health control, livestock research and training, marine or freshwater biological research, afforestation and other forestry projects, etc. Agriculture share in GDP is measured by the ratio of agricultural value added to GDP.","rationale_interpretation":"An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government\u2019s orientation to the agriculture sector.","data_sources":"Government expenditure data - administrative data of the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic (CT MoF KR) from reports on national, republican and local budget implementation.\nData on gross value added of agriculture and GDP (or GDP agriculture share) - Department of Economic Statistics and National Accounts of the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.","data_collection":"CT MoF KR submits reports on national, republican and local budget implementation on monthly and annual basis. \nGDP data are compiled by Department of Economic Statistics and National Accounts of the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic in accordance with Statistical Work Programme.","computation_methods":"Computation Method:\nAOI = (Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures) / (Agriculture Share of GDP), where\n1) Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures = (Central Government Expenditures on Agriculture) /\n(Total Central Government Outlays); and\n2) Agriculture Share of GDP = (Agriculture Value-Added) / GDP","comments_limitations":"Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data.
