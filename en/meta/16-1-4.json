Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live","organization_name":"The National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (Household Statistics Division)","contact_name":"Y. I. Kalymbetova","contact_email":"Y.Kalymbetova@stat.kg ","contact_phone":"(312) 66 41 64","organization_website":"www.stat.kg","definitions":"This indicator refers to the proportion of the population (adults) who feel safe walking alone in their neighbourhood. ","concepts":"The question measures the feeling of fear of crime in a context outside the house and refers to the immediate experience of this fear by the respondent by limiting the area in question to the \u201cneighbourhood\u201d or \u201cyour area\u201d (various formulations depending on cultural, physical and language context).","rationale_interpretation":"The concept of \u2018fear of crime\u2019 has been used in dozens of crime victimization surveys and the standard formulation used here has been seen as effective in different cultural contexts. It is important to understand that \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that may be even largely independent from actual experience, as the perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is mediated by a number of factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion and the media and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is an important indicator in itself as a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development.","data_sources":"The annual household survey includes questions on sense of security to be answered by household members aged 15 years and older.","data_collection":"Representative national household surveys, and crime victimization surveys.","computation_methods":"The proportion of population that feel safe is calculated by summing up the number of respondents who feel \u201cvery safe\u201d and \u201cfairly safe\u201d and dividing the total by the total number of respondents. ","comments_limitations":"While the measurement of fear of crime is widely applied in crime victimization surveys around the world, different practices exist in the operationalization of this indicator \u2013 for example, by not requiring the person to \u201cwalk alone\u201d or limiting the walking to \u201cat night\u201d. Further guidance on measuring the indicator are currently elaborated by UNODC in collaboration with victimization survey experts.","data_availability_gaps":"The NSC website","disaggregation":"Disaggregation by sex, age","references_documentation":"The Kyrgyz Republic SDG National Reporting Platform: https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io","indicator":"16.1.4","target_id":"16.1","sdg_goal":"16","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"16-01-04"}
