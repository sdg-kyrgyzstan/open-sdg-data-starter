The list of employees includes all employees employed under an employment contract (contract) for permanent, temporary or seasonal work for a period of one day or more, as well as employed owners of enterprises who received wages in this enterprise. In addition, employees working under a civil law contract are shown here, if these employees are not on the lists of other enterprises. The average number of employees per year is determined by summing the average monthly number of employees for all months of the reporting year and dividing the amount received by 12. A loan is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor provides funds directly to a debtor and receives a non-reviewable document as proof of an asset. These are overdrafts, mortgages, loans to finance trade loans and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created as a result of finance leases, as well as claims or obligations to the IMF in the form of loans. Credit lines and loan commitments provide a guarantee that unused funds will be available in the future, but no financial obligations/assets exist until such funds are actually provided.","rationale_interpretation":"To improve the skills of workers and production technologies, small industrial enterprises need financial support in the form of preferential loans, loans, etc. This indicator shows how widely financial institutions serve \"small-scale industries\" (small enterprises, including industrial ones).
