The reference population used in this report is based on WHO Child Growth Standards 89. The malnutrition of population can be measured by comparing children with this reference population. Each of three indicators - weight for age, height for age and weight for growth - can be expressed in units of standard deviation (z-score) based on the reference population median.","rationale_interpretation":"Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child stunting refers to a child who is too short for his or her age and is the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition. Stunting is a contributing risk factor to child mortality and is also a marker of inequalities in human development. Stunted children fail to reach their physical and cognitive potential. Child stunting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.","data_sources":"\u00abOn the situation of children and women\u00bb Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey conducted in the Kyrgyz Republic in accordance with the rounds of MICS international household survey.","data_collection":"Sample Household Survey \u00abOn the situation of children and women\u00bb, includes \u201cAnthropometric measurements of children under 5\u201d module.
