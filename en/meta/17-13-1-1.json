Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\u00a0- the most important indicator of national accounts, characterizing the state and development of the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic over a certain period.

The main indicators for calculating GDP by the production method are:\n1. Gross output (BB);\n2. Intermediate Consumption (PP);\n3. Gross value added (GVA) (3 = 1-2);\n4. Taxes on products (NP);\n5. Subsidies for products (JV);\n6. Net taxes on products (NPV) (6 = 4-5);\n7.

Specific gravity - indicates the importance, value, or influence of someone or something among homogeneous phenomena in a particular area of human activity/society. The specific weight of tax, wages, profits, etc. is calculated. d) The Producer Price Index for Industrial products (PPI) is a relative indicator that is formed on the basis of prices of manufacturing enterprises and characterizes their average change in the industrial products they produce.
