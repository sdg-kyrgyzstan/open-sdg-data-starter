The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive.\nAffected: People who are affected, either directly or indirectly, by a hazardous event.\nDirectly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets.\nIndirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and psychological consequences.","rationale_interpretation":"The disaster loss data on mortality is significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic events, which represents important outliers in terms of mortality, as they normally imply considerable numbers of people killed.
