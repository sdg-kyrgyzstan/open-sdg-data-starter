# This config file is for use with the `build_data` and `check_data` functions,
# which are helpers for implementations of Open SDG. This file allows easy use
# of those functions without altering Python code.

# Languages
# ---------
# This tells sdg-build to perform "translated builds" for each of the specified
# languages. Each build is in its own subfolder - one for each language.
languages:
  - ru
  - en

# Source directory
# ----------------
# This identifies the directory that holds the 'data' and 'meta' folders.
# The default, '', points to the root of this repository.

# Inputs
# ------
inputs:
  - class: InputSdmxMl_Multiple
    path_pattern: os.path.join('data', '*.xml')
    dimension_map:
      UNIT_MEASURE: 'Units',
      REF_AREA|KG: ''
    drop_dimensions: ['SOURCE_DETAIL']

# Translations
# ------------
# The allows control over the imported translations. This can be omitted if you
# are happy with the defaults. But if you are using custom translation repos
# or non-standard inputs (such as SDMX) then you can use this as needed.
#
# Each item must have a "class" which corresponds to classes in the sdg/translations
# folder. Further, each item can have any/all of the parameters that class uses.
# The defaults below show what is used when this is omitted.

  - class: TranslationInputSdgTranslations
    source: https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-translations.git

# Destination directory
# ---------------------
# This identifies a directory to hold the "built" files. The default is '_site'.
site_dir: _site

# Schema file
# -----------
# This identifies a file containing the schema (possible fields) for metadata.
# Currently this needs to be a prose.io config, and defaults to '_prose.yml'.
schema_file: _prose.yml

# Reporting status extra fields
# -----------------------------
# This allows the build to generate stats for reporting status by additional
# fields, beyond the default "status by goal" report.
reporting_status_extra_fields: []

# Data and metadata alterations
# -----------------------------
# If you would like to perform any data and metadata alterations, you will need
# to create a file called "open_sdg_alter.py" in the same folder as this file.
# To perform data alterations, it should include a function called "alter_data".
# To perform meta alterations, it should include a function called "alter_meta".
